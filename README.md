# Coq; Group Theory

In this project I try to prove any things in group theory that come to my mind.
Current goals are the general associativity rule and the first isomorphism theorem.

To solve the former problem, I first focused on an analogue situation for binary trees and
solved this one. Next I will try to adapt the solution to the group situation.
