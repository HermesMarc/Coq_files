(* 

Alice and Bob are wearing hats. On each hat either "true" or "false" is written. Both can see each otherâ€™s hats, but not their own hat. They are tasked with guessing their own hat color. If either person gets the color right, they win. 
They cannot communicate with each other in any way after the hats have been placed on their heads and they must both say their guess at exactly the same time. However, they can meet in advance to decide on a strategy. Find a strategy that guarantees a payoff.

Implicit Type hat_A hat_B : bool.

(* The strategy is that one of the players guesses that they both have the same value on their hats, and the second one guesses that he has a different value on his hat. *)
